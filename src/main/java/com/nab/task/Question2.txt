a) When the main method exits what would the value of count.getCount be?

Value of count.getCount will be 2000


b) If we introduced a third runner, i.e., CountRunner runnerC = new CountRunner(count),
what changes to the code will need to be made for count.getCount to return 3000 everytime the main
method is run?


class TestCount {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		Count count = new Count();
		CountRunner runnerA = new CountRunner(count);
		CountRunner runnerB = new CountRunner(count);
		CountRunner runnerC = new CountRunner(count); //Added
		runnerA.start();
		runnerB.start();
		runnerC.start(); //Added
		runnerA.join();
		runnerB.join();
		runnerC.join(); //Added
		System.out.println("count.getCount = " + count.getCount());
	}
}
